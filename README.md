# Inventory Discord Bot

I built this to be used as a DND inventory keeper, but you're welcome to use it however you'd like.
The main idea is that it can create characters with inventories full of items. It was just a small 
project done for fun.

If you have questions on installation, feel free to email me at chani.mores@gmail.com.

For more info on the actual commands, run `dnd!help` after the bot is up and running.

## Installation 

These instructions will help you get your own instance of the bot running on your computer. The "save files" for characters will be kept in ./inventory_saves/ as a JSON file that can be loaded in.

 ### 1. Grab a copy of this repo. 

If you want to easily update from this repo, install Git ([See this link here for info](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and open up a command prompt. Do `cd Documents` or wherever you want this bot's files to live, and write `git clone https://github.com/chanimores/inventory_dnd_bot.git`. This will create a new git repository and will pull down the code for you.
