### Inventory Discord Bot

I built this to be used as a DND inventory keeper, but you're welcome to use it however you'd like.
The main idea is that it can create characters with inventories full of items. It was just a small 
project done for fun.

If you have questions on installation, feel free to email me at chani.mores@gmail.com.

For more info on the actual commands, run `dnd!help` after the bot is up and running.

### Installation 

The main thing for the installation to keep in mind is that you are downloading the code to run your own 
instance that you can turn off/on at will. The "save files" will be kept in `./inventory_saves/` as a `JSON` 
file that can be loaded in.
